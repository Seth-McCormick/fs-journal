## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A keyword added to a selector that gives it special property of the selected element. :active, and :hover are ones i think will be some common ones i will use.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is the ability to specify which part of your code you want to give change to. Border, padding, color are a few examples. I can use it to my benefit by being more precise on what i want to change within my code.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Since the !important feature bypasses other code i could see running into problems that make other code ive written no longer working and can potentially mess up the project im building. If i set a margin that creates space on a certain piece of code but use !important on another piece because i cant debug the initial reason, i can end up relying on it and writing bad code in the long run.
