## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

the purpose of wireframing is to create a mock of the website you will be designing, usually you will collab with the company that way you can add and make changes before you get down to the coding. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low- a quick sketch of what the layout will be with some boxes. as basic as it gets, easier to get feedback on changes they want to see, (sketch on some paper) 


mid- no im ages or typography yet just smoothing out the rough edges, adding the next step in wireframing to show the layout more clearly.

high- adding images and text fillers to represent what the final look will be.
 

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

They can be in certain settings depending on the customer. In most cases i would say wireframing is worth it, it takes time to code out a project and having a clear idea of what is wanted before you start is the best option.

Using the resources you have around you i.e google or bootstrap to continue to learn the code that it entails.
wireframing may not seem all that needed when copying a mock page but will be used more later on in my career.
