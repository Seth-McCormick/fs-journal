## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

Making your primary function pop more with bolder text or background color and leaving your secondary functions lighter and just a border color. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

https://www.google.com/
https://www.apple.com/

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

It influences people by making things easier to navigate and people love simplicity. Just like how google did the search browser, its easy to deal with and they change up the logo depending on time of year and sometimes has a hidden game or so when you click the logo.
You can convey importance through design and even make things aesthetically pleasing.
