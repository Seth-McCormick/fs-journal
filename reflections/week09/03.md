## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 is an encoding schema used for representing binary data in a text format

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

the drawback of using base64 is the browser first needs to decode the base64 encoded strings and then decode the images as well.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

they are issues this day and age because multiplexing was invented which allowed delivering hundreds of files through a single connection compared to back in the day when we browsers had heavy limits on the number of concurrent  connections they could send to the server and base64 provided a way of working around that by using an already open http connection to deliver images directly embedded in the html or css.
