## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type -  if it holds a data value within its own memory space

Reference type -  contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data

Pointer type - takes a referent type 

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort

There are a lot more then javascript, they are also a lot more specific.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

they get stored somewhere they can be reused later, they differ because they value types get changed along the way.
