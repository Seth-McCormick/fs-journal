## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

information in a row is all the information pertaining to that particular thing and information in a column is a specific piece of information for each item in the table.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

create table if not exists foods(
    id int NOT NULL,
    name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    age string NOT NULL,
    description string NOT NULL
)

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;

delete from would delete a specific piece of information and drop would get rid of the whole table all together.
```
