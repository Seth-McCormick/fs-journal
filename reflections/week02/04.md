## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

it gives you a chance to be creative/see what your wanting everything to look like so you can create guidelines of you're gonna be putting on the page.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When im stuck i can use google or look back on journals. I also have the ability to connect with my peers as well as going back over lessons we have done and even can check my journal.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Not quitting is my biggest takeaway. I struggle with creativity and if i dont have drawn out plans of whats supposed to go there i just mentally cant go beyond that. what i see is what i do and i feel like i shouldnt even try to be a coder.
