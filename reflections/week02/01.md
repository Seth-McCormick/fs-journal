## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

Scope is the place which the variable can be used. var is globally scoped but const and let are scope blocked meaning they cant be seen outside the function.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is bringing your variables and your functions you declare to the top of the scope. I'm not entirely sure why this would be needed but im leaving this comment so i can ask next time im with an instructor.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

i would use let when i want to manipulate the variable down the line and const when i want it to stay a constant also when im having to break out of a block scope i would use var. All in all i would use let the most for its malleability.
