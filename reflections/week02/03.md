elements tab inside the inspect function. Using the elements selector helps you pinpoint exactly where things are located in your code along with being able to make changes inside it to see its effects with changing your code. You can also turn things on/off to see what they do.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment


Today was a very difficult day for me, problem after problem made it feel like i didnt get very far but my takeaway from today was stop comparing myself, i need to focus on the fundamentals of why something is happening and trace my code that way so i dont get hung-up and discouraged constantly.
