# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I finally understood how functions in JS tie into html
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

How well everything they teach you throughout the week stacks on top of everything and makes the checkpoint not so overwhelming.
- What are you struggling with?

Loops, they are gonna be the death of me and i just cant seem to understand how to write them. I understand that they make it so you dont need to constantly write the same thing over and over again but i just cant seem to wrap my head around it
- What would you count as a victory?

Writing javascript that actually works.
