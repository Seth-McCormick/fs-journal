## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

unit testing - Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation.

component testing - To test most Vue components, they must be mounted to the DOM (either virtual or real) in order to fully assert that they are working.

end to end testing -  end-to-end (E2E) tests provide coverage on what is arguably the most important aspect of an application: what happens when users actually use your applications.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

unit testing, in my opinion this reminds me of code small miss small. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

component testing seems to be the least useful, its almost immediately known if your components are not working and you need to make changes.
