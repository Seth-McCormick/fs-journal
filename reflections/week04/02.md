> **ðŸ“– [JavaScript Promises](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/02-Promises)**

## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

pending, resolved, and rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

it helps by making it cleaner and easier to read since we can attach callbacks to our promises.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

the then method is for resolved promises so we can decide what to do next.

the catch method is for failed promises and so forth it will display something else so we know what we need to fix.
