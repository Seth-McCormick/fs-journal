## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

 Helps you prevent bugs resulting in a shared mutable state, our private interface is unchangeable but we can implemented changes in our public interface without changing the data behind the scenes.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

a problem with closures underscore prefix could possibly lead to false sense of being private when it's actually not. 

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

We dont export it, we would do this when we want to have our code hidden from the public and so it cant be accessed.
