# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

this week was definitely the hardest week so far, i understood the point of the mvc pattern but i was struggling with how to organize the information when it came to the controller vs service.
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

the things i remembered came as a shock, i feel like i dont know anything yet here i am still making it.
- What are you struggling with?

I'm struggling with being able to memorize methods in javascript and what they do.
- What would you count as a victory?

Being able to get through this project, i was stuck for a while and didnt think i would be able to do it.
