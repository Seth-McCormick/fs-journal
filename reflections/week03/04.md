> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

it solves the problem of keeping a bunch of elements synced with the same data.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

the subscribe method, the unsubscribe method, and the broadcast method.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

My understanding is that the proxystate (the bouncer) if its ok for the data to go through and talk to the appstate (the vip) and if its ok then it can draw the information and share it with the DOM.
