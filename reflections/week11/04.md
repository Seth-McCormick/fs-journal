## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

My concerns are that i have had trouble retaining certain information and for me to look back on our projects that we have done i won't be able to remember what routes were taken so it will be hard for me to find the right stuff to reference. I loved the course and all the people i met but in the end im still not sure if this is the career field i want to be in even though it is enjoyable it still feels like something is missing for me and it could entirely be imposter syndrome. Time management has never been a big issue for me so ill just keep doing what i do and code some and not get burnt out or frustrated and take appropriate breaks.
